# karate-jar
The build for Karate 1.6.0 isn't available yet, but we need it to run our sandbox. Until the release becomes available [through the normal channel](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/releases), we will keep a copy here to download when building our sandbox image.

(I know it's not a good use of a repo to store a jarfile, but this is a temporary solution that avoids other headaches)
